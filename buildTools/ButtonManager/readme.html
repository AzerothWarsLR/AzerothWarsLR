<b>Frequently Asked Questions:</b><br />
Q: My antivirus says that this program is virus!<br />
A: If your antivirus detects this program as trojan, you probably have McAfee, Comodo, eSafe or Prevx. They don&#039;t know anything about exe-optimization-by-hands and UPX. Therefore I recommend to change antivirus.<br />
<br />
Q: What&#039;s all those BLP settings for?<br />
A: Check butman_readme_eng.txt.<br />
